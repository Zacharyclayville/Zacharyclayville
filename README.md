👋 Hi, I’m Zachary Clayville
I’m a student at Fort Hays State Tech Northwest in Goodland, Kansas, where I’m currently studying App Development & Emerging Technologies. I’ve been learning full-stack development using tools like Node.js, React, SwiftUI, and more.

Over the past several months, I’ve worked on multiple real-world projects some for clients, some team-based  that helped me build confidence and technical skills

🍔 Bite Bite A food and sorting management system I’ve been building for over three months. It helps manage food related data in an organized, efficient way. This has been my biggest project yet, and it’s taught me how to handle complex logic, structure a full app layout, and keep things user-friendly and functional.

🏀 Topside Tipoff Northwest/New Version  A basketball focused app built around the Topside Tipoff event held every year. This updated version was designed specifically for Northwest Tech to showcase brackets, team info, and schedules. I helped bring structure and design to the frontend and worked on keeping the user experience clean and smooth.

🛠️ Northwest Tech App  A past project that was originally intended to manage attendance and campus tools While it was never completed working on it gave me early exposure to backend systems and helped shape how I approach app development today.

Outside of school I work at Walmart where I’ve learned valuable soft skills like time management customer service and communication  all of which translate well into working with dev teams and managing technical tasks.

I’m passionate about building apps that serve a real purpose. Whether I’m working solo or with others, I like seeing things come together from an idea to something that actually works. I'm always improving, learning new things, and excited to grow into the tech field fulltime.
