👋 Hi, I’m Zachary Clayville
I’m a student at Fort Hays State Tech Northwest in Goodland, Kansas, and I’m currently in the App Development & Emerging Technologies program. I’ve been learning full-stack development and have spent a lot of time building apps using tools like Node.js, React, SwiftUI, and more.

Over the past few months, I’ve worked on several real-world projects  some were solo, others were with teams — and all of them helped me grow as a developer.

🍔 Bite Bite This is a food and sorting management system that I’ve been developing for over three months. I built it to help organize and manage food data efficiently. I handled everything from setting up the structure to building out the logic and making sure the app was smooth and user-friendly. It’s the most in-depth project I’ve worked on so far, and I’ve learned a ton from it.

🏀 Topside Tipoff  Northwest/New Version – I helped build this version of the Topside Tipoff app specifically for Northwest Tech. It’s focused on showcasing brackets, team details, and game schedules for the annual basketball event. I worked on the frontend, handled layout and design, and helped shape the user experience to make it clean and easy to use.

🛠️ Northwest Tech App  This was one of the first projects I ever worked on. It was supposed to be a campus attendance and management tool, but it never got finished. Still, it gave me early experience working on backend systems and taught me a lot about how to structure apps and solve problems from the inside out.

When I’m not coding, I work at Walmart, where I’ve developed strong soft skills like time management, problem-solving, and clear communication all of which help me when working on dev teams or building my own projects.

I’m passionate about making apps that actually help people. I like seeing my ideas come to life, fixing things that don’t work, and learning something new every time I build. I’m always pushing to get better, and I’m excited to keep leveling up and one day work full-time in the tech world.
