ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zachary Clayville
Iâ€™m a student at Fort Hays State Tech Northwest in Goodland, Kansas, currently studying App Development & Emerging Technologies. Iâ€™m learning full stack development using tools like Node.js, React, and SwiftUI.

Iâ€™ve worked on projects like:

A student check-out system ("Bye-Bye")

A version of the Topside Tipoff event app

An instructor attendance tracker for Northwest Tech

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m working at Walmart and always finding ways to improve my skills. Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and start building even better apps.
